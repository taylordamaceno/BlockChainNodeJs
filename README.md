# Blockchain Demonstration in Node.js

## Overview

This project provides a simple yet illustrative implementation of blockchain technology using Node.js. It demonstrates the creation of blocks, cryptographic hashing (SHA-256), and the proof-of-work mechanism known as mining. The application is designed to help understand the fundamental concepts of blockchain through the addition of new blocks and validation of the chain.

## Features

- **Block Creation**: Blocks contain data, the hash of the previous block, and their own unique hash.
- **Blockchain Integrity**: Maintains integrity by linking each block's hash to the previous block.
- **Proof-of-Work (Mining)**: Simulates the mining process through a basic proof-of-work system.
- **Chain Validation**: Ensures the blockchain's integrity by validating each block and the entire chain.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (Tested on version 16.x) - Download from [Node.js official site](https://nodejs.org/).
